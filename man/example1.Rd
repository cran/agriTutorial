\title{EXAMPLE 1: Split-plot design with one qualitative and one quantitative level factor}
\description{
Gomez & Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three management practices
(minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer
(0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3). The experiment
involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and nitrogen
fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, there were 45 treatments with
three replicates in complete replicate blocks. The fertilizer treatments were applied
 to main plots, the management practices to split-plots and the varieties to split-split-plots.

\details{
Section 1

Section 1 examines treatment effects by fitting qualitative factorial models and the first analysis
calculates a full analysis of variance (Table 1) for main plots (nitrogen),
split-plots (management) and split-split-plots (variety). Each type of experimental unit (or "stratum")
requires a separate error term in the fitted analysis.

The second analysis (Table 2) uses a REML mixed model analysis to find treatment means and SE's for each marginal
treatment classification averaged over all the other treatment factors, together with estimates of
pairwise contrasts of treatment means and the SE's of the pairwise treatment comparisons. This analysis fits
the full set of nitrogen-by-variety interaction effects assuming additive managment effects and the fit of the model
is tested by a graphical plot of the model residuals.
Residual plots provide an important check on model assumptions but many more options for model testing are
available and further methods for diagnostic testing are examined in the subsequent examples.

The third analysis (Table 3) shows a mixed model analysis of the full factorial model fitted by REML using the
lmer function of the lme4 package. Generally with mixed models, determination of the denominator degrees of
freedom for Wald-type F- and t-statistics becomes an issue, and here we use the method proposed by
Kenward & Roger (1997).

Section 2

Section 2 examines treatment effects by fitting polynomial models and the first step calculates
a full set of four raw polynomials for the 5-levels of N using the poly() function.
The N rates are re-scaled by division by 100 to improve numerical stability.

The second step fits a mixed model polynomial analysis of nitrogen effects assuming additive management effects (Table 7).
In this analysis, most of the nitrogen treatment effect can be explained by linear and quadratic trend effects.
but it is important to note that there is a non-negligible Variety x Cubic N interaction effect. This suggests
that not all the varieties responded in a similar way to the N treatments and that some further analysis of the
data may be required (see also the N plots of individual varieties and replicates in Fig 1).

The third step fits the required model for the actual fitted model coefficients (Table 8).
When estimating model effects, only effects that are significant for the fitted model or that are marginal to
those effects (functional marginality) should be included in the model therefore only linear and quadratic nitrogen effects
are included in this model. The fitted model for the nitrogen effects fits the actual actual nitrogen levels used
in the experiment therefore this model provides the required coefficients for the actual applied nitrogen levels.

Finally, individual plots of the nitrogen response for each variety in each block averaged over all management effects are
shown (Fig 1). These plots show the nitrogen response of each variety in each replicate block and
show some evidence of anomalous behaviour by variety 1 in blocks 1 and 2 compared with block 3. In practice,
this anomaly would need to be investigated by further discussion with the research workers.
